    <h2>Who is he?</h2>
    <p> Silas Morgan, commonly known as "Shepherd" is a player character for D&D live table campaign "Curse of Srathdanya" from Legends of Avantris. This character is played by Andy, one of the oldest memebers of said D&D group.</p>
<br>
    <p>Shepherd is a tiefling from a isolated village called Rattlesnake, Yona("wild west"). He grew up in said village, where after his parents were burned alive for blasphemy (fake claims), was raised by Dr. Thomas Cogburn, 
    a talented artificer who teached Shep how to use two arcane pistols called Judgement and Redemption. With time he became skilled with said guns, and started to defend the village to not only protect the village and Dr. Cogburn, 
    but to prove tha tiefligs are not bad people. He became known as the <div>"Devil of the Plains"</div>.</p>
